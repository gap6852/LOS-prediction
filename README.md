Machine learning and data mining techniques have been increasingly used to draw insights from healthcare data, which can aid public health agencies and hospitals in managing human and financial resources. Past studies in the field have examined the prevalence of intensive care admissions, diagnoses, and their complications, and have demonstrated growing potential to deliver impacts in the clinical setting [5]. For the current project, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database provides a comprehensive stream of patient hospitalization records that have proven useful in past descriptive, predictive, and hypothesis-driven studies

The objective of our analysis is to use data extracted from the MIMIC database to build two models, and to generate both predictive and exploratory insights from these models. The first model aims to predict the likelihood of a categorical outcome, being the length of a patient’s stay. Based on a patient’s characteristics and circumstances of admission, we will classify patients as likely to experience a short, medium, or long term stays. The second model aims to cluster patients based on the number of various patient-caretaker interactions – such as procedures, inputs taken, and drugs prescribed – which can quantify the amount of human or physical resources used by a patient during their stay. In all, we aim to combine two models to be able to explore both characteristics inherent to a patient’s background and condition, and attributes associated with a patient’s treatment process. By leveraging predictive analytics and by grouping patients by hospital resource consumption, we hope to generate insights that can better inform healthcare systems, allow for the proactive allocation of critical healthcare resources, and overall enhance patient care outcomes.
